## Build Instructions
* If you are downloading the source code and wish to build it, you will need the latest version of the official [Call of Duty: World at War Mod Tools](https://mega.nz/#!5kwyCYYQ!Onn3s3SfJjrombt7b1lUOcFYAtzhg9T_X7c4SvJljbs) installed first before continuing
* Drag & drop the "raw" folder, "mods" folder, and d3d9.dll file into your game's root folder. Some files will be replaced, this is normal (Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Call of Duty World at War) 
* Use the mod tools Launcher to compile each of the four mods (Check build .ff, build .iwd, and each item in the IWD file list)
