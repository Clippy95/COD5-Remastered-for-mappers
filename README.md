## Build Instructions
* If you are downloading the source code and wish to build it, you will need the latest version of the official [Call of Duty: World at War Mod Tools](https://mega.nz/#!5kwyCYYQ!Onn3s3SfJjrombt7b1lUOcFYAtzhg9T_X7c4SvJljbs) installed before continuing. I also recommend installing the community made [V1.1 Launcher patch](https://www.ugx-mods.com/forum/3rd-party-applications-and-tools/48/world-at-war-mod-tools-v1-1-pwned-w-linkerpc-fix/10245/).
* Drag & drop the "raw" folder, "mods" folder, and d3d9.dll (T4M) file into your game's root folder. Some files will be replaced, this is normal. (Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Call of Duty World at War) 
* Use the mod tools Launcher to compile each of the four mods. (Check "Build mod.ff FastFile" and "Build IWD File" in each)
* If notice any issues with the mod after compiling, please let me know. However, I tested the files on a fresh install and everything appeared to work.
* Keep in mind that not every script file (.gsc & .csc) in the \mods directory has been modified, but having them gives you complete control of every aspect of each map
