## Build Instructions
* If you are downloading the source code and wish to build it, you will need the latest version of the official [Call of Duty: World at War Mod Tools](https://mega.nz/#!5kwyCYYQ!Onn3s3SfJjrombt7b1lUOcFYAtzhg9T_X7c4SvJljbs) installed before continuing. I also recommend installing the community made [V1.1 Launcher patch](https://www.ugx-mods.com/forum/3rd-party-applications-and-tools/48/world-at-war-mod-tools-v1-1-pwned-w-linkerpc-fix/10245/).
* Drag & drop the "raw" folder, "mods" folder, and d3d9.dll (T4M) file into your game's root folder. Some files will be replaced, this is normal. (Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Call of Duty World at War) 
* Use the mod tools Launcher to compile each of the four mods. (Check "Build mod.ff FastFile" and "Build IWD File" in each)
* If notice any issues with the mod after compiling, please let me know. However, I tested the files on a fresh install and everything appeared to work.
* Keep in mind that not every script file (.gsc & .csc) in the \mods directory has been modified, but having them gives you complete control of every aspect of each map

### Zombies
* Zombies can now spawn with random combinations of helmets, hats, or gear based on rare % chances.
* Zombies can now use updated animations from future maps for traversing, crawling, attacking, hitting through barriers, walking, running, etc. The exception remains that Nacht zombies are "slower," they are more likely to stop before hitting than on other maps.

### Changes
* All weapons are consistent in stats and appearance between each map, with all using the best materials (either the HD materials from Singleplayer, or the weathered material if present).
* Certain weapons no longer share ammo reserves because it was a glitchy system.
* All added weapons (and their upgraded variants) use their official sounds, stats, names, effects, and materials unless non-existent. In such cases, they were created from scratch while still matching Treyarch's style.

#### Starting Pistols

* (Upgraded, all) Added muzzle flash effects
