## Build Instructions
* If you are downloading the source code and wish to build it, you will need the latest version of the official [Call of Duty: World at War Mod Tools](https://mega.nz/#!5kwyCYYQ!Onn3s3SfJjrombt7b1lUOcFYAtzhg9T_X7c4SvJljbs) installed before continuing. I also recommend installing the community made [V1.1 Launcher patch](https://www.ugx-mods.com/forum/3rd-party-applications-and-tools/48/world-at-war-mod-tools-v1-1-pwned-w-linkerpc-fix/10245/).
* Drag & drop the "raw" folder, "mods" folder, and d3d9.dll (T4M) file into your game's root folder. Some files will be replaced, this is normal. (Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Call of Duty World at War) 
* Use the mod tools Launcher to compile each of the four mods. (Check "Build mod.ff FastFile" and "Build IWD File" in each)
* If notice any issues with the mod after compiling, please let me know. However, I tested the files on a fresh install and everything appeared to work.
* Keep in mind that not every script file (.gsc & .csc) in the \mods directory has been modified, but having them gives you complete control of every aspect of each map

## Nacht Der Untoten
* Added intro screen text
* Added new musical Easter Egg to play "Undone" by shooting all 31 red barrels

### Zombies
* Zombies can now spawn with random combinations of helmets, hats, or gear based on rare % chances.
* Zombies can now use updated animations from future maps for traversing, crawling, attacking, hitting through barriers, walking, running, etc. The exception remains that Nacht zombies are "slower," they are more likely to stop before hitting than on other maps. Nacht-unique "sprint" crawlers are still present.
* Reorganized zombie vocals to have more consistency between ambient, attack, and sprint categories. Added new behind vocals category.
* Added a new type of "super sprinter" that comes after round 10, toggleable in Game Options.
* Replaced the existing grey uniform zombie variant texture with an SS camouflage texture, which fits better with the battlefield atmosphere of the map.

### Characters
* Added characters. Instead of randomizing the player models for each character, each Player (1, 2, 3, 4) always has a consistent player model.
* Added new generic voiceover taken from Campaign assets using factory style code. Includes categories for weapons, low ammo, close kill, damaged close kill, explosion cough, explosion kill, flamethrower kill, headshot kill, killstreak, scared breathing, pain, reload, player surrounded, player responses, powerups, downed/mandown, revived/revived teammate, Insta-Kill melee, and level start.

## Verr端ckt
* Renamed map from Zombie Verr端ckt to Verr端ckt, like in future Call of Duty titles

### Zombies
* Zombies can now spawn with random combinations of helmets, hats, bandages, or gear based on rare % chances.

* Added a second new type of "super sprinter" that comes after round 10, toggleable in Game Options.

### Characters
* Added characters. Instead of randomizing the player models for each character, each Player (1, 2, 3, 4) always has a consistent player model.
* Changed player models and player viewmodel hands to use Marine Raider recon gear. These Marines were supposed to be a "recon team" in the story and it helps differentiate them from the Marines on the previous map. 
* Rewrote voiceover to use factory style code. 
* Reorganized voiceover categories to be less repetitive and more consistent. Added new category for powerups, perks, (cut) Teddy Bear, and (cut) downed lines.

### Changes
* All weapons are consistent in stats and appearance between each map, with all using the best materials (either the HD materials from Singleplayer, or the weathered material if present).
* Certain weapons no longer share ammo reserves because it was a glitchy system.
* All added weapons (and their upgraded variants) use their official sounds, stats, names, effects, and materials unless non-existent. In such cases, they were created from scratch while still matching Treyarch's style.

* (Upgraded, all) Added muzzle flash effects
