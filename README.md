## Build Instructions
* If you are downloading the source code and wish to build it, you will need the latest version of the official [Call of Duty: World at War Mod Tools](https://mega.nz/#!5kwyCYYQ!Onn3s3SfJjrombt7b1lUOcFYAtzhg9T_X7c4SvJljbs) installed first before continuing
* Drag & drop the "raw" folder, "mods" folder, and d3d9.dll (T4M) file into your game's root folder. Some files will be replaced, this is normal (Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Call of Duty World at War) 
* Use the mod tools Launcher to compile each of the four mods (Check "Build mod.ff FastFile" and "Build IWD File" in each)
* If you encounter issues (red or green error messages--missing assets), please let me know, I may have missed some assets when uploading the raw contents
* Keep in mind that not every script file (.gsc & .csc) in the mods directory has been modified, but having them gives you full complete control of every aspect of each map
