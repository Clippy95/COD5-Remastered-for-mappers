2. “Peter's Intel” - Peter's radio can be dislodged using an explosive and dropped to the ground, but only Dempsey can recover it. To get a strong enough signal with the radio, you must go to the Comm Room main desk and power on the hub by succesfully completing a random three-long sequence in the correct order. After the radio hub is powered on, place your handheld radio on the desk to send your message, and pick it up after the message completes. However, before sending this message (at any point) there are two prerequisites that must be met, ensuring Dempsey has the required intel. First, the spawn room radio message must have been activated and completed by interacting with the three radios placed throughout the room. Second, Dempsey must have interacted with the 115 Meteor.
